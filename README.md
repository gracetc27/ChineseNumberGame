# ChineseNumberGame
This project is a Chinese number learning game. Each round, it displays a chinese symbol (with the option to view the pinyin equivalent),
then thw user must pick out of 4 options as to which is the correct translation. They play 5 rounds and their score is tracked. When they choose
their answer, either the chinese sound is played on success, or a failure sound if they were incorrect. The user can go into a settings view to 
change the volume of these sounds.
